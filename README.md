# data-modelling

INTRODUCTION

This document provides an overview of the data modeling project and its purpose. It includes information on the project's goals, data sources, data models, and any relevant technical details.

GOALS

The goal of this project is to create a data model to store and analyze data stored in Amazon S3 using AWS Glue and Athena.
Data Sources.
The data for this project was obtained from the AWS Open Dataset, stored in Amazon S3.
The data includes information on various topics and entities, as specified in the AWS Open Dataset documentation.

DATA MODELS

The data model for this project was created using AWS Glue to extract the schema and other information from the data stored in Amazon S3.
A visual representation of the data model was created using Athena, which generated the table DDL used to build the data model.
The database management system used for this project is Amazon Athena.

DEPLOYMENT

The data model was deployed by executing the table DDL generated by Athena.
The following technology and infrastructure requirements were necessary for this project:
Amazon S3 for data storage
AWS Glue for schema extraction and data crawling
Amazon Athena for data analysis and data modeling

CONCLUSION

This data modeling project has allowed for efficient storage and analysis of data from the AWS Open Dataset in Amazon S3 using AWS Glue and Athena.
The data model created provides a flexible and scalable solution for future data analysis and business intelligence needs.
